## I'm Fassih! 👋

## 💻 Full-Stack Developer | DevOps Enthusiast

**Problem-solver by nature** - I identify pain points and build innovative solutions  
**Recent graduate** Full-Stack Development @HolbertonSchool 
**Passionate about** automation, developer experience, and eliminating repetitive tasks  
**Philosophy**: If it's manual and repetitive, it should be automated ⚡
**Located in** Thonon-Les-Bains, France 🏔️

## 🎯 My Approach

**Identify → Innovate → Automate → Scale**

I don't just write code, I solve problems:
- 🔍 **Spot inefficiencies** in my daily workflows  
- 💡 **Design solutions** that eliminate friction
- 🔧 **Build tools** that others actually want to use
- 📈 **Think product** - from MVP to business model (like ErrorAPI concept (**spoiler alert !**))

*Examples*: Tired of Docker setup → Built MKDF | Need better backups for my projects → Created s4v3my4ss with network discovery

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

### 🔧 [MKDF](https://github.com/Noziop/mkdf) - Project Generation Revolution
***Currently evolving from C to Python for better developer experience***
*"I was tired of setting up Docker projects manually every time"*  
→ **One command creates complete development environments**
- **The Problem**: Developers waste hours on project setup, port conflicts, boilerplate
- **My Solution**: Smart project generator with automatic port and docker-subnet detection and Docker orchestration  
- **Innovation**: Zero-config approach - just say what you want, MKDF handles the complexity
- **Impact**: milliseconds instead of hours for project initialization

### 💾 [Save-me from myself](https://github.com/Noziop/save-me_from_myself) - Enterprise Backup System
*"Why do enterprise backup solutions cost thousands when you just need reliability?"*  
→ **Production-ready backup system with zero-config network discovery**
- **The Problem**: Small teams need enterprise-grade backups without enterprise budgets or complexity
- **My Solution**: Intelligent backup system that discovers your infrastructure and just works
- **Innovation**: Automatic rsync server detection, incremental backups, and elegant CLI interface  
- **Impact**: From manual backups chaos to automated peace of mind
- **Tech**: Go architecture, network scanning, rsync optimization, interactive CLI
- **Approach**: AI-assisted development to explore Go while maintaining focus on system design

### 🌟 [Stellar Studio](https://github.com/Noziop/stellar-studio) - Astrophotography Platform
***PoC - Next version incoming with enhanced microservices architecture***
*"Processing telescope data shouldn't require a PhD in astronomy software"*  
→ **User-friendly (for beginners) platform for space telescope image processing**
- **The Problem**: FITS astronomical data is complex, existing tools are researcher-focused and intimidating
- **My Solution**: Modern web platform making astrophotography accessible with intuitive workflows
- **Innovation**: Microservices architecture (FastAPI + Vue.js) with real-time processing monitoring and automated image processing pipelines.
- **Vision**: Bridge between raw telescope data and stunning final images for astronomy enthusiasts
- **Tech**: FastAPI, Vue.js, MariaDB, Docker, Prometheus monitoring

### 🎲 [SOD Tirage](https://github.com/Noziop/SOD_Speaker-Of-the-Day_Drawing_system) - PHP Learning Project
*"Learning PHP/Slim by tackling a real classroom challenge"*  
→ **Personal project to master new framework through practical problem-solving**
- **Learning Goal**: Master PHP/Slim framework beyond basic tutorials
- **Inspiration**: Daily speaker selection at @HolbertonSchool (no automated system)
- **My Approach**: Build a constraint-based solution instead of doing theoretical exercises
- **Challenge**: Implement fair distribution algorithm with business rules (preferences, history) - *still needs improvement, though*
- **Outcome**: Solid PHP/Slim skills + functional MVP (though never deployed at school)
- **Lesson**: Learning through real problem-solving beats tutorials every time

### 🚀 [Portfolio Interactive](https://github.com/Noziop/3D-portfolio-a-journey-through-space)- 3D Space Exploration
*"Why settle for static portfolios when you can explore your projects in 3D space?"*
→ **Immersive 3D interface built with Vue.js + Three.js**
- **Innovation**: Interactive space exploration metaphor for project presentation
- **Tech**: Vue 3 Composition API, Three.js rendering, advanced CSS animations
- **Features**: Real-time radar, planetary navigation, performance monitoring HUD
- **Vision**: Future of scientific data visualization and immersive interfaces

## 💻 Technical Skills

**Core Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C  
**AI-Assisted Development - Learing purpose**: Go (project architecture & system design), CLI design, three.js
**Web Technologies**: FastAPI, Vue.js, HTML/CSS, REST APIs  
**DevOps Tools**: Docker, microservices architecture, monitoring concepts  
**Infrastructure**: Linux, networking, backup systems, rsync, NAS
